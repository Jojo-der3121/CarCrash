   Hello there everyone who thought it was a good idea to download CarCrash! :D
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 here are few interesting informations for you! ^^

 so first of 1. :

	=> in order for you to play Multiplayer (or rather for those who want to host a online Multiplayer session):
	
		You'll need to make some adjustments to your W-lan router in order host a GameRoom.
		More specificly you'll need to give CarCrash the permission to use the port 307.
		This is because the game is locally hosted (on your PC) and does not rely on a seperated Server.
		
		If you are wondering how to do that. Just ask me =)
		We will be able to accomplish it if we are working toghether ! :D
		
		in order so that someone can join you you'll need to give them your IP adress.
		
		=> You can use the following Link in order to find out which IP-adress your PC has:
		https://www.whatsmyip.org/
		
	=> if you want to join a Session:
	
		You'll need to get the IP adress of the host. (just ask him)
		When you have the IP adress you'll need to go to options and select joining IP.
		Now just write the IP adress of the host.^^
		
		(i'd recommand using strg+c to copy the adress that the host send you, after you have selected it with your mouse cursor,
		 and then paste it using strg+v in Joining IP in the OptionsMenu)
		
		If you didn't understand how to do it please let me know. =)
		
  And now for the real meat and potatos >:]
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	If you want to Play the Game just open the Carcrash.exe file ! :D

	And if you're bored by the local Single Player but you haven't achieved a score of at least 75,
	you haven't seen anything yet ! xD trust me.. >=3
	
	And even if you know what happens after your score hits 75,
	you should still try to improve since there's still a lot waiting for you ! ^^
	
	try to climb the Ranks and be on top of your LeaderBoard !:D ^^
	
	
I hope you'll enjoy this little game i made ! ^^ :D
